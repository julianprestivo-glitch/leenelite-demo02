Vercel Preview Deployment - Instructions
Project name you requested: leenelite-demo
Preview username you requested: leenelite

1) Create a GitHub repo and push these files, OR upload this folder directly when creating a new Vercel project (Import Project -> Upload).
2) On Vercel, before deploy, set Environment Variables (Project Settings -> Environment Variables):
   - PREVIEW_USER = leenelite
   - PREVIEW_PASS = <choose-a-strong-password-here>
   (Set them for Production)
3) Deploy. The middleware will enforce HTTP Basic Auth (browser prompt).
4) After preview, delete the project from Vercel Dashboard to remove the site permanently.

Notes:
- No password is in the source. You control it via Vercel env vars.
- If you prefer Netlify or GitHub Pages approach instead, tell me.
